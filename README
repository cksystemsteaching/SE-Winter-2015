Our current version does a correct switch between the kernel 
and the user process (as discussed in lecture).  Additionally, 
we implemented a scaffold to move syscalls into the kernel- 
process.  

The initial user process is a binary that is loaded during 
startup.  

Page fault handling and process forking is currently not 
supported. 

Our demo starts a counter and shows switching between kernel and 
user process.
